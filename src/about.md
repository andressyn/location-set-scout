We connect producers and agencies with locations in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area to shoot commercials, films, still photography, music videos and branded content.



We collaborate and scout with directors and production designers to fulfill the visual aesthetic and overall creative vision of their project.



Once the location is locked, we ensure clearance and multiple site visits are available to all key crew members, so the necessary creative and technical scouts are completed before the shoot takes place.



We have an eye for architecture, knowledge of landscapes and the ability to research and visualize how a location could be turned into a set.



We provide extensive local knowledge and have access to a vast number of unique locations ready for any project or vision.
