1. Location Scouting
Location scouting helps bring the creative vision to life. What places or environments will your characters inhabit? Where will key scenes be set?

Our Location Scouts collect landscapes and interiors from life, or from imagined worlds, that evoke the world of a film. Our scouts go into the world and find locations that match the script, storyboard and or any references provided to them. With some guidance from the director and producer, our scouts find places to shoot that coincides with the director’s concepts and fits in the producer’s budget.

Our scouts use a combination of online research and direct communication within our own database to find great spots to film.

We will investigate potential sets themselves to ensure the best result for the project. We then accompany Directors and Producers to narrow down the search to find the perfect fit for the production.

Once the final location or locations are selected by the creative and production teams, our scouts then negotiate for the use of the location. Our scouts then work alongside the Location Manager to arrange logistics with the crew and with local officials who will give permission to film at the location.

2. Location Library
Whether you are looking for a house, an office, a warehouse, an open field, a sports arena, a school, a church, a beach, a bar, a restaurant, a flower shop, a bookstore, an open road, a dirt road, a trail, a cliff, a pool, a lake, you name it... we will find the perfect fit for your project!

3. Location Managing
Once the locations are locked in following the location scouting process, the location manager steps in to take over.

Our managers handle the logistics needed to make that location work, like paying the property owners, securing permits, and alerting neighbors about the film shoot. The location manager then works alongside the production designer and art department to ensure the location is prepped, available and ready for the days of filming. Our location managers oversee and hire the entire location department to make this all possible.

Our location manager’s job differ from other film crew jobs in that they are not explicitly involved in the actual filming. Our managers only maintain the space where filming is set to take place, act as the community liaison, dealing with pedestrians, angry neighbours or anyone that can interfere with the filming.

Once the production is finished filming at a location, it is our manager’s job to oversee all cleanup and make sure the location is in the same condition as they found it.
